- As a user, I want to start a voice call with my emergency contact.
- As a user, I want to notify all the remaining users of a certain case.
- As a expert, I recieve the call for help and get the location of the person in need to reach out.

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework, designed for building apps on multiple platforms like iOS, Android, and also web applications.
<!-- - For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database. -->
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/notifications) which supports Android and iOS.
